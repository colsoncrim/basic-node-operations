1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work
   and what the output was.

   - sort commands.js returned each line of the commands.js file in alphabetical order
     starting with "break;"

   - wc commands.js printed the number of lines in the file (37), the word count (73),
     and byte count (800) in commands.js

   - uniq commands.js returned exactly what I have printed in commands.js. If there were
     any lines that were the same, uniq would remove it from the output.


2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain
   what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

   I ran uniq commands.js | wc and the terminal returned 37  73  800. Since there are
   no duplicate lines in this file, it has returned the same output that was displayed
   when running wc commands.js.


6. Given a string, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while
   maintaining the original word order and whitespace and return the string. To improve
   your problem-solving experience, use the suggested functions to solve the problem.


   const reverseString = (string) => {
    return string.split('').reverse().join('');
   }
